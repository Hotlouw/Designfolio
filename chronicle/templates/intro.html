		<p>My name is Johan Louw (Going by Joe).<br></p>
		<p>I am 42 Years old.<br></p>
		<p>I live in South-Africa, in a small town called Stilfontein.<br></p>
		<p>I am married, with 3 kids.<br></p>
		<p>I studied Software Development after school, but my financing ran out, and i had to go work.<br></p>
		<p>I worked for a decade in Hardware, as a Workshop Manager in a Computer, network and maintenance shop. <br></p>
		<p>Then I went and spent another decade in Distribution, specifically selling semi-finished Engineering Plastics & Digital Signage Supplies.<br></p>
		<br>
		<p>Never forgetting my original dream, about 2 years ago, I started my studies in coding & software development again.<br></p>
		<p>I fell in love with Python, thanks to all the different libraries and the community.<br></p>
		<p>Please check my Projects and Certifications. I am proud of what i am able to do now...<br></p>
